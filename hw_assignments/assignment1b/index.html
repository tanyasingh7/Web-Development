    <article>During the summer of 2018, my family embarked on a trip to India for a month. As my grandparents were unable to join us that previous Spring to attend my high school graduation, they had planned a graduation party in India with all of my family and cousins. As a form of a graduation present, my parents allowed me to plan the itinerary for our trip to India. Typically, my family would usually just stay at our grandparent’s home and hang out in the same area for the majority of our trip. However, since my parents gave me the privilege to plan where we were going and staying - I decided to make the most out of it. Whenever my family visited India, we would mainly just stay in Punjab. While I had visited the bigger tourist attractions such as the Taj Mahal and the Golden Temple before, the last time I had gone I was very young and barely remembered any of it. I decided that we would visit Goa, Mumbai, Punjab, and Agra, and smaller towns within the states.</article>
